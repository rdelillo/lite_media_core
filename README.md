### ‚ú® What is `lite_media_core`?

`lite_media_core` is a minimalist, developer-focused Python framework for handling media operations simply and intuitively. Designed to be lightweight, easy to integrate, and powerful enough for real-world workflows.

Whether you're building media automation tools, integrating transcoding features, or scripting quick metadata checkers, `lite_media_core` helps you get there faster with less friction.

### üåü Features

- **Clean and intuitive API**: Handles [image](https://rdelillo.github.io/lite_media_core/api/sequence/#image), [image sequence](https://rdelillo.github.io/lite_media_core/api/sequence/#imagesequence), [video](https://rdelillo.github.io/lite_media_core/api/movie/#movie), [audio](https://rdelillo.github.io/lite_media_core/api/audio/#audio)... Get started in seconds
- **Powered by MediaInfo**: Delivers accurate, detailed metadata across formats
- **Plug-and-play utilities**: Built-in helpers for timecode, resolution, and frame rate settings
- **Cross-platform**: Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Tested and linted**

---

### Practical Use Cases

`lite_media_core` helps automate key media validation tasks across ingest, quality control, and delivery workflows.

- ‚úÖ **Validate media against client specs**: Check resolution, frame rate, codec, pixel format, and embedded timecode.
- üéûÔ∏è **Detect issues in image sequences**: Find missing frames or inconsistent resolutions before ingest or export.
- üé¨ **Inspect QuickTime files**: Verify color range settings (video vs full) or codec compatibility for web or broadcast delivery.

### ‚ö° Quick Start

```bash
pip install lite_media_core
```

Inspect an image sequence:
```python
from lite_media_core import ImageSequence

# Load a media using lite_media_core
media = ImageSequence("/path/to/sequence.1001-1005.exr")

# Read sequence properties if it exists.
if media.exists:

    # Print basic media properties
    print(f"Loaded media: {media.path}")
    print(f"Resolution: {media.resolution}")
    print(f"Frame range: {media.frame_range}")

    # (Optional) Full metadata
    print("Full metadata:")
    print(media.metadata)
```
